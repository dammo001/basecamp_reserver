# basecamp_reserver
-u (username) and -p (password) are required values. This script uses a headless chrome to log in to the burlingame basecamp (optional with -l) and register for a class at 06:15 AM (optional with -t -- make sure you pass single digit times with a leading 0, i.e. 05:15 not 5:15). Basecamp classes are made available at midnight for the next week, so you should probably run this on some sort of cronjob for 12:01 AM for any day you want to register for.
